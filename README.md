# -- IMPORTANT UPDATE! --
This project is currently unmaintained because GNOME decided to make it possible to download extensions from the extensions.gnome.org website. Unfortunately, they have apparently removed the ability to install extensions via zip files in the GNOME Tweak Tool so I am not sure why they made the downloads possible if you can't really use them. I will look for a solution but it seems the best solution at this point is installing via command-line.

-------------------

## EGO Zip Downloads Userscript
At the current time, the [Extensions.GNOME.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/) website only supports a small number of browsers via the GNOME Integration plugin using NPAPI as the backend. This project is to make it easier for anyone to use the website regardless of which browser they prefer.
